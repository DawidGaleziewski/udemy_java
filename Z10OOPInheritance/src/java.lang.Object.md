java.lang.Object is a class that is a class that each other class extands.
If a class does not extand another class explicitly, it will implicitly extand Object class
Therefore when we create a class under the hood java extands this object and inherits its methods (like i.e toString).
When we add toString() to our new class, we override original class.
